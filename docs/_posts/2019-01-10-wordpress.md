Oh, no, not again!

![wp-admin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrBatsu/blog/master/docs/images/wp-admin.png){: .align-center}

Here I find myself again, staring at the login dialog for another Wordpress install.

I didn't miss Wordpress a bit. Not a tiny little bit. And now I'm stuck with it again, trying to help out.  
Every single tweak requires a trip to Duckduckgo, or Stack Overflow, or reddit, seaching for a piece of CSS that needs to be included so the site will behave as expected. Need a taller header ? CSS. Need a non-round logo ? CSS. Need a wider area text ? CSS.

Damn you, Wordpress.
