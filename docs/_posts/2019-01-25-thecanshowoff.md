We love coffee. We also love vending machines.

Imagine the fun we had in Japan (and a bit in Hong Kong) with the selection we had every morning. We would chase down a different vending machine every single day, trying to pick a new brand, one we hadn't tried yet. Easy to do, given the amount of brands on sale all through the city.  

Used as we are to our national _bica_ we didn't expect to get addicted to coffee in a can, but we did. And quickly too!
