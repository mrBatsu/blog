One of the things everyone seems to be doing is posting a screenshot with their specs. Doing the same here.

Using [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) and a wallpaper from the amazing [Waneella](https://www.patreon.com/waneella/posts), which I'm proud to sponsor on Patreon. You can also follow her on Instagram, [@waneella](https://www.instagram.com/waneella/).  

At the moment, after a few distro tries, I'm sticking with Manjaro, the [i3 edition](https://manjaro.org/download/i3/). Loving it. I'll get back to this later, how I got here, and why I love it. There's enough for a whole post there.
