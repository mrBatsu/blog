 A [tweet](https://twitter.com/brunoamaral/status/1084429537159585794) from Mr. Bruno Amaral made me sign up for an app.  
 The app is called Be My Eyes and according to their own words
 
 > Be My Eyes is an app made up of a global community that connects people who are blind or have low vision with sighted volunteers and company representatives through a live video call.
 
 It's a brilliant idea, and I can't wait to be of assistance to someone who needs my eyes. 
 
 You should [go download](https://www.bemyeyes.com/) the app, and sign in as a volunteer.
