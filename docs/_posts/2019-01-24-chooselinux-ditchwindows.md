[Jason Evangelho](https://twitter.com/killyourfm)'s Linux adventure goes on. Today we have a new podcast, [Choose Linux](https://chooselinux.show/). Already listening to the first episode, and it's good.  
If you're looking into moving your stuff to the Linux side, he also has a new site, [DitchWindows](https://ditchwindows.com/), where you can follow his own move to the penguin side. He's already written a ton of stuff, so you'll be busy for a while.
