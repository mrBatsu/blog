I've been away from Flickr for a while, using it mainly as an archive for my work.  
We came back from _theAmazingHoneymoon_ and I just started uploading the thousands of photos we took during the three-month long trip around Asia, and the four months we spent at Príncipe before that.  

I started thinking that maybe I should use Flickr a lot more than I do now, and I'm going to try harder to post and interact there in 2019. While I'm uploading I'm setting a few of the photos to Public, and I plan to do that to a lot more this year.

I even decided to participate in the [Your Best Shot 2018](https://www.flickr.com/groups/yourbestshot2018/) competition, with this photo I took while we were living at the amazing Príncipe island.

You can find me at [flickr.com/photos/maique](https://www.flickr.com/photos/maique/).  
Hope to see you there.
