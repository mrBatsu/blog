Today I'm taking a break from WordPress hell, and taking some photos. Yay!  

It's been a while, and being stuck at home trying to wrangle a WordPress theme has been both time consuming, and a learning experience. Hadn't done anything in WordPress for a while, and now I wish all sites could be deployed to GitHub Pages using some static site engine or other. It's sooo much easier, and a lot less prone to headaches.  

Anyway, one day off and then it's back to the same task. Can't say I'm glad.
