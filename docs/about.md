Hey, it's mrBatsu, another [maique](http://twitter.com/maique) alter ego. The geekier one.  

Here we are, again. While trying to learn some stuff about Linux I decided to keep a journal of the process. That, and some other computer and web related stuff, might show up here.  I thought about hosting this _blog_ on Wordpress but seemed more appropriate setting it up on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), and managed with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).  

Enjoy.  

You can find the real me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maique) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/maique). That's where I spend most of the time when I'm not out and about, shooting something.
