My real occupation is being a photographer. Travel and Set Photographer. That's what I love, that's what I've been doing for over a quarter of a century.  

On one of my last assignments for the newspaper where I worked for close to two decades, I went to an amazing place called Príncipe. That's where I met my wife. That's where I proposed to her and that's where we married last year.  

If I had to pick a special place in the world, Príncipe would be it.  
Last year we spent four months on the island, and I dream about the day when we return almost every day. Today I saw one of the photos from last year, on Vanity Fair.

It made me happy, but now I want to go back even more than usual. I want to see that view again with my eyes and smell that jungle. I miss Príncipe.
